This programm was designed for my capoeira group `Mare Alta` for use in our tournament.
Its job is to simplify the point calculation as well as the determination of the next round.

To use this program you will need an excel file similar to the provided example in this repository.
You can add as many categories and people as you want.
The groups in each category are determined automatically at random.
